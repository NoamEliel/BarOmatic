## BarOmatic 2.0 GUI
BarOmatic 2.0 is a graphical event planning tool for mobile bar companies and event organizers.
It calculates drinks, staff, equipment, and costs based on guest count, event duration, time of day, and selected bar types â€” giving you real-time, accurate planning.

## ðŸš€ Highlights
Modern WPF GUI â€“ No more console input, just a clean, interactive interface.
11 Bar Types Included â€“ Espresso, Cocktails, Beer, Wine, Soda, Shakes, and more.

## ðŸ§® Why BarOmatic Matters
Event planning for mobile bars is usually based on intuition and experience, with managers estimating drinks, staff, and equipment on the fly.
While this works, it often leads to inconsistent results and hidden inefficiencies.

BarOmatic 2.0 translates these human, experience-based decisions into precise algorithms, accounting for subtle factors like:
- Guest behavior at different times of day
- Variations between different events
- The combined effect of multiple selected bars
- Dynamic scaling over longer event durations
This level of modeling is challenging to code, as it requires blending real-world patterns with flexible calculations.
but the result is a reliable, repeatable system that eliminates guesswork and optimizes event planning.
